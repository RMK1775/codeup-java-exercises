/*
Create a class called Dish. This class will represent various restaurant dishes.
Include an integer property called “costInCents”
Include a string property called “nameOfDish”
Include a boolean property called “wouldRecommend”
Include a method called “printSummary” with a void return type
    this method will use a single printf method to print out the values of each of the instance properties in the following format:
      Cost: COST_IN_CENTS_HERE
      Name: NAME_OF_DISH_HERE
      Recommended: BOOLEAN_VALUE_OF_WOULD_RECOMMEND_HERE
Create another class called DishTest
Add a main method and inside the method...
    1) instantiate a Dish object and assign it to a variable called dish1
    2) assign creative values for each of the properties
    3) test the printSummary() method by invoking it and checking if all instance values are correctly printed (edited)
 */
        /* - AVERAGE_COST_OF_DISH_IN_CENTS - an integer constant set to 13000
      - shoutDishName() - that takes in a Dish object and prints out the name in all caps
      - analyzeDishCost() - that takes in a Dish object and will print out either “More expensive than average” or “Less expensive than average”, depending on the value of the dish costInCents compared to AVERAGE_COST_OF_DISH_IN_CENTS
      - flipRecommendation() - that takes in a Dish object and reverses the wouldRecommend boolean value
